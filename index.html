                <p>
                <h2 class="storyline">STORYLINE</h2>
                An absolute beauty to anyone, Shouko Komi in reality suffers from extreme social anxiety and
                communication
                problems, making her largely unable to talk to others. However, her attractiveness and stoic appearance,
                which in itself results from her anxiety, is perceived as refined class, making her highly popular while
                preventing people from actually getting to know her. Komi's first conversation with Tadano is over a
                blackboard, and she uses a notebook to convey her feelings through writing. Despite this, she is still
                capable of verbal conversation over a cell phone. Her dream is to overcome her communication problems
                and
                make 100 friends.

                Yuji Itadori, a kind-hearted teenager, joins his school's Occult Club for fun, but discovers that its
                members are actual sorcerers who can manipulate the energy between beings for their own use. He hears
                about a cursed talisman - the finger of Sukuna, a demon - and its being targeted by other cursed beings.
                Yuji eats the finger to protect his friends, and ends up becoming Sukuna's host. However, Yuji discovers
                that he has inherited magic and is able to control this power without interference from Sukuna. He joins
                the Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical College to consumes all of Sukuna's fingers, which will enable a
                full exorcism to take place that will free him.
